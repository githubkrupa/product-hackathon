# GradRise - A job readiness platform grounded in mental wellbeing
Product Management Club Hackathon submission

Problem Statement:
Develop an innovative solution that simultaneously bridges the experience-knowledge
gap while providing integrated mental health support throughout the job search journey.
This solution should help graduates translate theoretical knowledge into demonstrable
skills, create meaningful differentiation in their applications, navigate the increasingly
AI-mediated application landscape, and maintain psychological resilience throughout the
process. The ideal solution will recognize that mental wellbeing and professional
development are interdependent facets of a successful career launch.
